After Ukraine recently recaptured more territory than Russia's army took in the last six months, Russia's Ministry of Defense last Saturday named Sergey Surovikin as its new overall commander for operations in the war.

Notably, he previously played an instrumental role in Russia's operations in Syria - during which Russian combat aircraft caused widespread devastation in rebel-held areas - as Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces.

CNN spoke to a former Russian air force lieutenant, Gleb Irisov, who served under him in Syria.

He said Surovikin was "very close to Putin’s regime" and "never had any political ambitions, so always executed a plan exactly as ​the government wanted."

Analysts say Surovikin's appointment is highly unlikely to change how Russian forces are carrying out the war but that it speaks to Putin's dissatisfaction with previous command operations. It is also, in part, likely meant to 'mollify' the nationalist and pro-war base within Russia itself, according to Mason Clark, Russia Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think-tank.
